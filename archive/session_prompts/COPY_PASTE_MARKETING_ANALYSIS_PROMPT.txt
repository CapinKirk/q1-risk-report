# Marketing Performance Analysis - Paid Ads Vendor Meeting Prep

## Context
I'm preparing for a vendor meeting with our paid ads agency. I need analysis of where marketing is underperforming, specifically around MQL generation, inbound conversion weakness, and where we're losing deals. Help me build talking points and identify specific areas the vendor needs to address.

**Report Period:** Q1 2026 QTD (January 1-12, 2026)
**QTD Progress:** 12 days / 90 days = 13.33% through quarter

## SECTION 4: FUNNEL CONVERSION ANALYSIS

### Where Leads Are Dropping Off

#### High-Performing Conversions (Keep Doing This):
| Product | Region | Source | MQL→SQL | SQL→Won | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| R360 | AMER | INBOUND | 70% | 79% | Excellent conversion when leads come in |
| POR | EMEA | INBOUND | 125%* | 20% | Strong SQL gen, need more volume |

|---------|--------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| POR | AMER | INBOUND | SQL→Won | **16%** | Leads not closing |

## SECTION 7: KEY QUESTIONS FOR VENDOR

### Must-Answer Questions:

1. **R360 AMER Inbound MQL Crisis (24% pacing)**
   - What is the current R360 US paid spend?
   - What's the impression → click → form fill → MQL conversion funnel?
   - CPL trend - are we paying more for worse results?
   - Which campaigns/ad groups are underperforming?

2. **APAC Market Failure (0-11% MQL pacing)**
   - Are we running ANY paid campaigns in Australia?
   - What's the budget allocation APAC vs AMER vs EMEA?
   - Should we reallocate APAC budget to higher-performing geos?

3. **R360 Pricing Objection Pattern (70% of losses)**
   - What's our targeting criteria? Are we attracting SMBs without budget?
   - Can we add budget/company size qualifiers to lead forms?
   - Are competitors out-bidding us on enterprise keywords?

4. **POR "Not Ready to Buy" Pattern (100% of losses)**
   - What's the content/offer in our POR ads?
   - Are we using bottom-of-funnel CTAs or top-of-funnel content?
   - Should we implement lead scoring before passing to sales?

5. **TRADESHOW Source at Zero**
   - Is digital supporting tradeshow lead capture?
   - Are tradeshow leads being tagged correctly in CRM?
   - What's the follow-up campaign for tradeshow leads?

6. **OUTBOUND Channel Underperformance**
   - How is paid supporting outbound SDR efforts?
   - ABM campaign performance?
   - Are we retargeting accounts in SDR sequences?

## SECTION 8: RECOMMENDED TALKING POINTS

### Opening Statement:
"We're 13% through Q1 and have significant gaps in marketing-sourced pipeline. R360 inbound is at 24% of MQL target, which puts $263K in bookings at risk. I need to understand what's happening and see a recovery plan."

### Key Data Points to Emphasize:
1. "R360 AMER needs 63 more MQLs to hit QTD target - we're generating 20 when we should have 83"
2. "When R360 leads DO come in, conversion is excellent (79% SQL→Won) - the problem is VOLUME not QUALITY"
3. "70% of R360 losses cite pricing - are we attracting the wrong buyer profile?"
4. "APAC is effectively zero - both products, both MQL and revenue"
5. "Tradeshow source is showing zero activity - is attribution broken or is there no campaign?"

### What I Need From Vendor:
1. Campaign-level performance data for R360 AMER (last 30 days)
2. Geographic spend breakdown (AMER vs EMEA vs APAC)
3. CPL trends by product and region
4. Creative performance analysis
5. Keyword/audience targeting review for R360
6. Recovery plan with weekly MQL targets to get back on track

## SECTION 9: REVENUE IMPACT CALCULATOR

### If We Fix MQL Gap, What's the Upside?

Assumptions:
- Current MQL→Won rate: ~10%
- Current Avg Deal Size: ~$5,000

| Gap Area | MQL Gap | Expected Wins | Expected Revenue |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| R360 AMER INBOUND | 63 | 6.3 | $31,500 |
| POR APAC INBOUND | 15 | 1.5 | $7,500 |
| R360 EMEA INBOUND | 7 | 0.7 | $3,500 |
| POR EMEA INBOUND | 4 | 0.4 | $2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **89** | **8.9** | **$44,500** |

**Just getting back to MQL target pacing = ~$45K additional Q1 bookings**

At current win rates, if we can 2x the MQL volume (fully fix gap), that's ~$89K in additional Q1 bookings potential.

## What I Need You To Do

1. **Analyze this data** and identify the 3 most critical issues with specific revenue impact

2. **Create executive summary** - 3 bullet points I can use to open the meeting

3. **Build question framework** - prioritized list of questions by impact

4. **Suggest optimizations** - based on loss reason data, what targeting/messaging changes should we push?

5. **Draft accountability framework** - what metrics should I hold the vendor to weekly/monthly?

6. **Calculate break-even** - at what CPL does paid become unprofitable vs. other channels?
