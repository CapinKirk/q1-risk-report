## KEY INSIGHT: COVERAGE vs ATTAINMENT PARADOX

**Critical Finding:** EXPANSION segments have LOW pipeline coverage but HIGH attainment, while NEW LOGO/MIGRATION have HIGH coverage but LOW attainment.

| Segment | Coverage (Future) | Attainment (Past) | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| AMER EXPANSION | 0.37x CRITICAL | **141.5% ON_TRACK** | Converting well, needs more pipeline |
| APAC EXPANSION | 0.13x CRITICAL | **327.5% ON_TRACK** | Outperforming massively |
| AMER MIGRATION | 1.40x HEALTHY | **0% BEHIND** | Pipeline exists but not closing |
| AMER NEW LOGO | 3.35x STRONG | **23.3% BEHIND** | Lots of pipeline, poor conversion |

**Takeaway:** EXPANSION is executing well despite low coverage. MIGRATION and NEW LOGO need focus on deal progression and close rates.

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. MIGRATION - Urgent Close Focus
- All regions have healthy/strong pipeline (1.4x - 2.6x) but AMER/APAC have ZERO closed deals
- **Action:** Daily migration deal review with sales leadership
- **Focus:** Identify blockers preventing migration deals from closing

### 2. NEW LOGO - Conversion Problem
- AMER has 3.35x coverage but only 23.3% attainment
- APAC has 7.18x coverage but 0% attainment
- **Action:** Review NEW LOGO pipeline quality and qualification criteria
- **Focus:** Are these real opportunities or inflated pipeline?

### 3. EXPANSION - Pipeline Generation
- All regions hitting/exceeding targets despite low coverage
- **Action:** Maintain close momentum, generate more expansion pipeline
- **Focus:** Don't let success mask the coverage gap

### 4. INBOUND - Mixed Results
- EMEA strong (137.3%), AMER behind (68.5%), APAC zero
- **Action:** Regional playbook sharing from EMEA to AMER/APAC
- **Focus:** What is EMEA doing differently?
