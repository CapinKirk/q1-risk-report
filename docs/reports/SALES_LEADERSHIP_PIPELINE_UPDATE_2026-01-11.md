## TO-DATE ATTAINMENT (NEW SECTION)

**Important:** Coverage and Attainment are DIFFERENT metrics. This section shows actual closed-won performance vs targets.

### Key Distinction:
| Metric | What It Measures | Time Period | Question Answered |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Coverage** | Pipeline health | Future (Jan 11 - Mar 31) | Do we have enough pipeline? |
| **Attainment** | Actual performance | Past (Jan 1 - Jan 11) | Are we hitting targets? |

### MTD Attainment Summary (Jan 1-11)

**Overall: 82.6% Attainment** ($284,625 actual vs $344,485 target)

| Region | Target | Actual | Attainment | Pacing |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| APAC | $21,450 | $14,644 | 68.3% | 60.3% |
| AMER | $216,618 | $176,611 | 81.5% | 89.2% |
| EMEA | $106,416 | $93,370 | 87.7% | 90.9% |

### Coverage vs Attainment Paradox

**Critical Finding:** EXPANSION has LOW coverage but HIGH attainment. MIGRATION/NEW LOGO have HIGH coverage but LOW attainment.

| Segment | Coverage | Attainment | Interpretation |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| AMER EXPANSION | 0.37x CRITICAL | **141.5%** | Closing well, needs pipeline |
| APAC EXPANSION | 0.13x CRITICAL | **327.5%** | Outperforming massively |
| AMER MIGRATION | 1.40x HEALTHY | **0%** | Pipeline not closing |
| AMER NEW LOGO | 3.35x STRONG | **23.3%** | Conversion problem |

### Updated Action Items

1. **EXPANSION:** Build more pipeline (closing is not the issue)
2. **MIGRATION:** Focus on deal progression and close rates (pipeline exists)
3. **NEW LOGO:** Review pipeline quality - lots of coverage but poor conversion
